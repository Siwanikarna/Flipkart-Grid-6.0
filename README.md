# Exercise 2
# **Chat Application - Real-Time Console Chat**

## **Overview**
This Java-based project is a simple real-time chat application that allows users to create and join chat rooms. It implements a client-server architecture where users can interact through a console. The focus of this application is on message exchange, chat room management, and client-server communication.

## **Features**
- **Chat Server**: Handles multiple chat rooms and manages user connections.
- **Chat Client**: Connects to the server, allowing users to join and participate in specific chat rooms.
- **Multi-user Support**: Users can join multiple rooms, and messages are shared across all participants in a room.
- **Concurrency**: Uses Java's concurrent collections to handle multiple chat rooms and users.

## **Project Structure**
The application consists of the following key components:

- **Server**: Manages client connections and handles communication for different chat rooms.
- **Client**: Connects to the server, sends messages, and receives real-time updates from the server.
- **`ClientHandler` (Inner Class)**: Manages each client connected to the server, running on a separate thread for concurrency.

## **Key Classes and Methods**
1. **`ChatApp` (Main Class)**
   - **`startServer()`**: Initializes the server socket on a specified port (5000). Waits for incoming connections and starts a new thread (`ClientHandler`) for each client.
   - **`startClient()`**: Connects to the server and allows users to send and receive messages via console input/output.

2. **`ClientHandler` (Inner Class)**
   - Handles individual client connections.
   - Manages message broadcasting within a chat room.
   - Implements the logic for creating, joining, and leaving chat rooms.

## **How to Run**
### **Requirements**
- **Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher)** installed on your system.

### **Steps to Run the Code**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Jahnu36/Real-time-Chat-Application-Programming-Exerciseee
2. **Compile the Java Files**: Navigate to the directory containing the Java file and compile it using the javac command:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/ChatApp
   javac ChatApp.java
3. **Run the Server**: Start the server using the following command:
   ```sh
   java ChatApp server
This command will start the server on port 5000 and wait for client connections.


4. **Run the Client**: Open a new terminal window and run the client:
   ```sh
   java ChatApp 

This will start a chat client, connecting it to the server. Users can then interact with the server and join chat rooms.

## **Usage Examples**
**Example 1: Creating a Chat Room and Messaging**
1. Client 1 starts and creates a room named "RoomA".
2. Client 2 joins "RoomA" and sends a message.
**Output Example**

## **Commands**
Clients can use the following commands:
- create [room_name]: Create a new chat room.
- join [room_name]: Join an existing chat room.
- leave [room_name]: Leave the current chat room.
- !users: To see active users in room
- !quit: Exit the chat application entirely.

## **Logging and Exception Handling** 
- Logging: The server console provides updates on connected clients and errors.
- Exception Handling: The application handles I/O exceptions gracefully, ensuring the server continues running without interruption even if a client disconnects unexpectedly.
## **Design Patterns Utilized**
- Singleton Pattern: The server ensures that the chat room manager is a singleton instance.
- Observer Pattern: Implements real-time updates to clients when a new message is posted in a room.
- Command Pattern: Commands are used to handle client requests, such as joining rooms or sending messages.
